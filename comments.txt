- Updated pom.xml JCenter repo to use https (http not working anymore in 2020)
- Docker: why don't linking all containers in a network to avoid changing IPs?
- Fixed security issue with CSRF (all web API calls returned 403 Forbidden)
- Move "/" to "/products" to create "/addresses"
- Should we apply validations to age, email? (null, format)
- Can an account have 0 addresses (domain question)?
- Integration / E2E tests should be created (pretty important!)
- Missing return in ProductAPI:37
- Aggregate / composition implementation of Account -> Address depends on front
- Frontend search doesn't scale at all -> use backend search via API queries
