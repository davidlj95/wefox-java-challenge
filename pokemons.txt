The SQLite database for pokemons has been obtained from

https://veekun.com/dex/downloads
https://veekun.com/static/pokedex/downloads/veekun-pokedex.sqlite.gz

The SQLite database has been reduced to only contain the basic information we
need (the identifier and some attributes) as the initial size of the database
was 50+MB. The reduced size is ~48KB.

To do so, we just kept the "pokemons" table and created an index
"ix_pokemon_identifier" to search by the pokemon name.

The commands used to do so are:

```sh
# Remove all tables except pokemon
sqlite3 veekun-pokedex.sqlite \
    'SELECT "DROP TABLE " || name || ";" FROM sqlite_master WHERE name NOT IN
    ("pokemon");' \
    | sqlite3 veekun-pokedex.sqlite
# Add index to retrieve pokemons by name (identifier)
sqlite veekun-pokedex.sqlite \
    'CREATE INDEX "ix_pokemon_identifier" ON "pokemon" ("identifier");'
```
